# Climate-Genie

A web extension for debunking climate disinformation. Built in two key parts, a community reporting system and a web app. Implemented into the chrome web store as an extension

## Web App

Using community submitted debunking statements, a 'climate genie' will pop up along-side the article and debunk the false statements in the article. The genie will refer the reader to more reputable links.

## Community reporting system

By clicking on the extension while on a page, the user will have an option to report the current page for climate disinformation. After the user codifies the type of disinformation, the report will be added to a database and displayed for other users to confirm. After enough reports are confirmed, the report will then be presented by the climate genie when people access the reported page.
