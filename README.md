# Climate-Genie

A web extension for recognising and debunking climate misinformation. Built in two key parts, a community reporting system and a web application. Implemented into the chrome web store as an extension.

## Web Application

Using community submitted debunking statements, a 'climate genie' will pop up along-side the article and debunk the misinformation in the article. The genie will refer the reader to more reputable links.

## Community Reporting system

By clicking on the extension while on a page, the user will have an option to report the current page for climate misinformation. After the user codifies the type of misinformation, the report will be added to a database and displayed for other users to deconstruct and debunk. After being verified, the report will then be presented by the climate genie when people access the reported page.
