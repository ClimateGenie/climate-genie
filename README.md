# Climate-Genie

Built in conjuction with the Monash Climate Change Communcation Hub, this web extension seeks to address the issue of Climate Change misinformation in Australian media.

Utilising the CARDS API created by Dr John Cook and Dr Travis Coan, the Climate Genie web extension parses news articles related to Climate Change, checking each paragraph for misinformation, to then present the idenitified misniformation and a counter.

This application runs off of Javascript with the supplement of a personal Flask API for dynamic debunk claims for each identified misinformation claim.
